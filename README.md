APOPT Solver

APOPT (for Advanced Process OPTimizer) is a software package for solving large-scale optimization problems of any of these forms:

Linear programming (LP)
Quadratic programming (QP)
Quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP)
Nonlinear programming (NLP)
Mixed integer programming (MIP)
Mixed integer linear programming (MILP)
Mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP)

Applications of the APOPT include chemical reactors, friction stir welding, prevention of hydrate formation in deep-sea pipelines, 
computational biology, solid oxide fuel cells, and flight controls for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). APOPT is supported in
AMPL, APMonitor, and Pyomo.
